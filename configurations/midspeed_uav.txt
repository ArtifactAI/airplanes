This configuration describes a mid- to high-subsonic UAV or manned aircraft with a focus on aerodynamic efficiency and maneuverability at moderate speeds. It has swept inboard and outboard wing panels, with a thicker inboard section to perhaps accommondate landing gear packaging. The wing uses a NACA 4409 airfoil, which is thicker and likely designed for good lift-to-drag performance. at subsonic speeds. The anhedral angle (negative dihedral) in the outboard section may increase maneuverability, at the expense of stability. The horizontal tail uses a thinner NACA 0406 airfoil, and the vertical tail uses a NACA 0404. The fuselage is relatively slender supporting 1-2 passengers or a small payload.

For control, the configuration has flaps on the wings (for increasing lift at landing), ailerons, and an elevator.
